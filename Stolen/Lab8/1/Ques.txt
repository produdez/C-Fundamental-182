Write a program to read a set of positive integer numbers (less than 100 numbers) from a text file.


Know that in that file, each number is seperated by spaces or end-of-line symbols.


The number -999 is the signal of ending input. Note that -999 is not a member of the set you have to read.


In the "process" function, return false if the file does not exist.


Print on screen each different number in ascending order, and the number of occurences of each different number in that file. 


The output has two columns. The first is 10-character length. The second should be as short as possible.


testcase:


15 40 28 62 95 15 28 13 


62 65 48 95 65 62 65 95 95 -999


expect:
